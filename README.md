# Avengers Login Screen (Android App)

This is a simple **Avengers-themed Login Screen** built using **Kotlin + XML** in Android Studio.  
This project is made **for learning purposes only** while I am practicing Android development.

- Email & Password input fields  
- Login button with basic validation  
- Kotlin-based Activity  
- XML layout with colors, styles, and drawable assets

I created this project to learn:

This is **not a real authentication app** — it is only a UI practice project.
